Game structure
- we refer to the two players as *investor* and *investee*
- state consists of
  * turn: indicates whether next move is investing or returning
  * timeLeft: how many time steps are left in the game (-1 means infinite horizon)
  * investments: history of amounts sent by investor (most recent in position 0)
  * returns: history of amounts sent by investee (most recent in position 0)

  //* endowments: a dictionary {'investor': x, 'investee': y} specifying
    how much both players received in endowments in this stage

- we allow integer transfers not exceeding money available to player
- gameParams configure the game as follows:
  * investorEndowment: how much does investor get at the start of each round
  * investeeEndowment: how much does investee get at the start of each round
