## webppl-trust

WebPPL trust library. It provides means of creating *cognitive agents* 
operating in a *cognitive stochastic multiplayer game*. 

## Usage
To use the library, one must define all the components specific to 
the modeled scenario. In particular, this includes:
1. Game Setup, specifying the usual stuff such as states, actions, 
transition function as well as game API (described below) and other
novel components to do with rewards. Game setup should be specified
as a function which accepts game-specific parameters as input and
returns an object containing the following fields:
    * actions :: State -> [Action] <br/>
    a function that retrieves **actions** available to an agent
    in a given *state*
    * transitionFn :: (State, Action) -> State <br/>
    a function that gives a **state** to which the game transitions
    given that *action* was taken in a *state*
    * initialState :: State
    * API :: Object 
    specifies definitions of several functions which are used by the
    library but their implementations are game-specific, such as
        * getPreviousState :: State -> State <br/>
        given a *state*, returns a **state** that preceded *state* in
        the execution of the game. Normally states encode execution
        histories, so implementation of this function is trivial
        * getLastAction :: State -> Action
        * isInitial :: State
        * turn :: State -> Agent <br/>
        retrieves an **agent** that takes action in (owns) a given 
        *state* 
        * other :: Agent -> Agent <br/>
        given *agent* return the other **agent** (under assumption 
        there are only two agents)
        * stateToString :: State -> String
    * physicalRewards ::
